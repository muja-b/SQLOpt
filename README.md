# SqlOptimizer

SqlOptimizer is a web application designed to analyze and optimize SQL queries. The project consists of a backend Web API and a frontend built with Razor Pages.

## Project Structure
- `SqlOptimizer.Web`: ASP.NET Core Web API backend
- `SqlOptimizer.Frontend`: ASP.NET Core Razor Pages frontend

## Idea
